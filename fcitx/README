NOTE:

  This port enables both GTK2 and GTK3. Qt has been disabled as it uses Qt3 
  and Qt4. For Qt5 support you will need to build fcitx-qt5 port separately.

  You will also need to add the following lines to your profile.

  GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
  QT_IM_MODULE=xim
  XMODIFIERS="@im=fcitx"

EXTRA:

  This is not a howto. It is purely my notes on what I did to enable 
  Chinese input. Who knows, it may end up being helpful for anyone who is 
  having difficulties with it.

    - Installed fcitx.
    - Installed fcitx-qt5 input module for Qt5 applications.
    - Installed fcitx-configtool-gtk3 since I have both GTK2 and GTK3.
      I decided to go with the GTK3 version as it looks nicer.
    - Since the window login manager is slim on one machine I edited 
      ~/.xinitrc. On the other machine I edited ~/.xsession as it uses xdm 
      as its login manager. I added the following lines. 
        
        export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
        export QT_IM_MODULE=xim
        export XMODIFIERS="@im=fcitx"

    - To get fcitx daemon to start automatically when I log in. I added 
      this extra line to ~/.xinitrc on the slim machine and to ~/.xsession 
      on the xdm machine.
        
        /usr/bin/fcitx-autostart

    - The rc startup script for dbus was already enabled.
    - I had already installed all the fonts in the xorg repository as well 
      as the fonts from romster's and alan's repository. The reason is that 
      I do a lot of work abroad and I need to be able to read documents and 
      websites in foreign languages. So I am not entirely sure which fonts 
      are needed for Chinese characters to display correctly.
    - After logging in to the desktop environment, in my case fluxbox I 
      then right clicked on the fcitx tray icon and selected configure. Under 
      the 'Input Method' tab I clicked the + and then unticked the box that 
      says 'Only Show Current Language'. I typed in the search box 'Pinyin' 
      and selected 'Pinyin' only. I then went to the 'Global Config' tab and
      under 'Extra key for trigger input method' I selected 'ALT_L_SHIFT'.
    - I then opened up a GTK2, GTK3 and a Qt5 application and tested it on
      each of them. The input method worked fine using the left 'Alt+Shift' 
      keys to change from English to Chinese. I didn't change any other 
      settings.
