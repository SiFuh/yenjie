NOTE:

  On some computers skypeforlinux won't launch unless chrome-sandbox
  is set suid. I do not like the idea of this and therefore I have not
  allowed it in the Pkgfile. If skype for linux doesn't launch then 
  you should do the following after installation. 

  sudo chmod 4755 /opt/share/skypeforlinux/chrome-sandbox
