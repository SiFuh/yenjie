NOTE:

  To verify the build you should uncomment the line make test located in the 
  Pkgfile. 

  QTGUI will fail. This is because root does not have access to the Xdisplay. 
  This is completely normal. If you wish to see if qtgui does pass the test 
  then you can either try running the command 'xhost +' before compiling this 
  port to allow root to access the Xdisplay or run the command 'ctest -V -R 
  qa_qtgui' as a normal user in the $SRC/gnuradio/build folder, provided that 
  you used the -kw flag when building this port to keep your working 
  directory.

        # qa_qtgui                              (Failed)
