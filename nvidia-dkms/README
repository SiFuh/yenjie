README for nvidia 1xx.xx+



*** NOTE for nvidia with udev ***

If using udev, add your user to the "video" group to be able to
use the nvidia devices required for 3d to function properly.

IMPORTANT:

    If you have any previous versions of nvidia-dkms installed, it is recommended
    that you run 'dkms' and remove the previous versions of nvidia's dkms modules
    before you update to the current nvidia-dkms version. Also, you can take a 
    look in the directory /var/lib/dkms/nvidia/ and remove any unnecessary build 
    files for the previous nvidia version you may wish to replace. 

    example:
        dkms unbuild -m nvidia -v <VERSION> -k <KERNEL-VERSION>
        prt-get update -fr nvidia-dkms 

NOTE:

    Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a program/framework that enables
    generating Linux kernel modules whose sources generally reside outside the
    kernel source tree.

    To use this feature it is recommended to run dkms after compiling a new
    kernel, specifying the new kernel version with the flag -k. To list which
    modules you have that are in the dkms tree you can simply run the command
    dkms status. Running the command dkms add -m <module> -v <version> will add
    the module to the dkms tree. Likewise running the command dkms build -m
    <module> -v <version> will build the module to the current kernel version,
    or more specifically dkms build -m <module> -v <version> -k <kernelversion>
    will build the module for a chosen kernel version.

    If you'd like to build dkms modules on boot up then adding the lines below
    to /etc/rc.modules should suffice. However, this should be added before any
    modules that you wish to load with modprobe.

        if [ -x /usr/sbin/dkms ]; then
          /usr/sbin/dkms autoinstall
        fi

    An example of what an /etc/rc.modules file would look like would be
    something like this.

        #!/bin/bash
        #
        # /etc/rc.modules: module initialization script
        #

        /sbin/depmod -a

        if [ -x /usr/sbin/dkms ]; then
          /usr/sbin/dkms autoinstall
        fi

        modprobe 88XXau
        modprobe tuxedo_keyboard

    You will find the location of the dkms links to your modules under the
    directory /var/lib/dkms/<modules>-<version>. There will be a source link
    directly to the location of the module which should be located under
    /usr/src/<module>-<version> unless the user specifies a different location.

    If you wish to remove a specific module you can run the command dkms remove
    -m <module> -v <version> -k <kernelversion>.

    For further information it is highly recommended that you read the man pages.
