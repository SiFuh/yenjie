NOTE

  Use "ip" and "iw" instead of "ifconfig" and "iwconfig"

  For setting monitor mode

      1. Fix problematic interference in monitor mode.

      $ airmon-ng check kill

  You may also uncheck the box "Automatically connect to this network when it is 
  avaiable" in nm-connection-editor. This only works if you have a saved wifi 
  connection.

      2. Set interface down

      $ sudo ip link set wlan0 down

      3. Set monitor mode

      $ sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor

      4. Set interface up

      $ sudo ip link set wlan0 up

  For setting TX power

      $ sudo iw wlan0 set txpower fixed 3000


  LED control, statically by module parameter in /etc/modprobe.d/8812au.conf or 
  wherever, value can be 0 or 1, for example:

      options 88XXau rtw_led_ctrl=0

  Or dynamically by writing to /proc/net/rtl8812au/$(interface name)/led_ctrl, 
  value can be 0 or 1, for example:

      $ echo "0" > /proc/net/rtl8812au/$(your interface name)/led_ctrl


  Check current value:

      $ cat /proc/net/rtl8812au/$(your interface name)/led_ctrl


  USB Mode Switch, 0: doesn't switch, 1: switch from usb2.0 to usb 3.0 2: switch 
  from usb3.0 to usb 2.0

      $ rmmod 88XXau
      $ modprobe 88XXau rtw_switch_usb_mode=<int> 


  NetworkManager, newer versions of NetworkManager switches to random MAC address. 
  Some users would prefer to use a fixed address. Simply add these lines below at
  the end of file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and restart 
  NetworkManager.

      [device]
          wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no
